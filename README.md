# TMA-Project-final
Project for the subject TMA

In this repository we have the following codes
	Device_classifier: 3 classifiers (Bagging, Random Forest and KNN) from inside and putside the network that classifies our devices 
	Device_classifier_withSampling: Same as before but we tryied to see if having sampling would change the results
	IoT_classifier: 3 classifiers (Bagging, Random Forest and KNN) from inside and putside the network that classifies the flow to be IoT or Non-IoT
	IoT_classifier_with_Sampling: Same as before but we tryied to see if having sampling would change the results
	deep_learning: Use of multi-class neuronal networks to classify the devices
	deep_learning_iot: Use of binary neuronal networks to classify between IoT and Non-IoT
